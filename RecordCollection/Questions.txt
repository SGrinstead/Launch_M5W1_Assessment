How would you rate your comfort level and abilities when working with a SQL database? (3 points)

I would say that I am fairly comfortable working with an SQL database. For my school projects we used PostgreSQL databases. We first learned SQL queries and how to interact with the
database directly, then moved to using c# and .NET to interact with the database using tools like LINQ. I make sure to practice SQL queries to make sure I keep those skills sharp.
One of my school projects was an MVC app where users could record messages that other users could see. I used an SQL database to save information about the users like their name and
hashed passwords as well as their messages. Most of that application was some form of database interaction including saving to the database, editing information in the database, or removing
something from the database.


How do you familiarize yourself with a codebase you haven’t worked in before? (3 points)

When I need to familiarize myself with a new codebase I start by running the application if I can before looking through the code to get an idea of the purpose of the program. Once I
have done that, I will look at any models in the code as those are ususally the foundation of a lot of other pieces. Finally, I would look through the other major parts of the program 
like Program.cs or any controllers if it is an MVC application. As an example, I had an exam on a codebase I hadn't seen before, so I ran the program and saw that it was an MVC app
about albums where you could add albums to the list with a title, artist, and rating. Then I looked through the models, and there was just one Album class with those same properties and an id.
From there I could look through the controllers and get a good idea of everthing the program was doing.
